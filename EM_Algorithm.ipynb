    "The expectation-maximization algorithm, or commonly called the EM algorithm, is an iterative approach for finding the maximum likelihood estimate for an unknown parameter $\\theta$ of a statistical model, where the model is dependent on another unknown and unobserved latent variable. \n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we have a training set of $\\{x^{(1)},...,x^{(m)}\\}$ independent samples, and we wish to use this dataset to estimate $\\theta$ in a model dependent on $z$ and $\\theta$. In this case, $z$ is our unobserved latent variable. If $z$ is known, finidng the maximum likelihood estimate for $\\theta$ may be straightforward. However, if $z$ is not observed, the task is not as straightforward and the EM algorithm is often used in such situations. \n",
    "\n",
    "Normally, finding the maximum likelihood estimate involves finding $\\theta$ that maximizes the log-likelihood of the data. The $\\theta$ maximizing the likelihood and log-likelihood are the same because the $log(x)$ function is a monotonically increasing function. Let $x$ represent the training set $\\{x^{(1)},...,x^{(m)}\\}$, $l(\\theta)$ represent the log-likelihood of $\\theta$, $f(\\theta)$ represent the likelihood of $\\theta$, and $p(x^{(i)};\\theta)$ represent the probability of observing $x^{(i)}$ under the model parameterized by $\\theta$, then:\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "$$ln(f(\\theta)) = l(\\theta) = \\sum_{i=1}^{m}log\\:p(x^{(i)};\\theta)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "If however, the model includes a latent variable $z$ that can take on $u$ values with a probability distribution $Q$, then the log-likelihood expression should be further broken down to reflect that:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$l(\\theta) = \\sum_{i=1}^{m}log\\sum_{j=1}^{u}p(x^{(i)}|\\:z^{(j)};\\theta)\\:Q_{i}(z^{(j)})$$\n",

    "\n",
    "Let us first state Jensen's inequality - Jensen's inequality states that given a convex function $f$ and a random variable $X$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$E[f(X)] \\ge f(E[X])$$\n",
    "\n",

    "$$E[g(X)] \\le g(E[X])$$\n",
    "\n",
    "for concave functions. With Jensen's inequality defined, let us use it to understand the inequality in the log-likelihood expression. Since $Q_{i}(z^{(j)})$ means the probability of $z^{(j)}$ for sample $x^{(i)}$, $Q$ is a probability distribution. Let $g = log(x)$ be our concave function. We can then hold the view:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$log\\sum_{j=1}^{u}\\frac{p(z^{(j)}, x^{(i)};\\theta)}{Q_{i}(z^{(j)})}\\:Q_{i}(z^{(j)}) = g\\Big(E\\Big[\\frac{p(z^{(j)}, x^{(i)};\\theta)}{Q_{i}(z^{(j)})}\\Big]\\Big)$$\n",

    "\n",
    "Thus by Jensen's inequality extended to concave functions, the last inequality expression for the log-likelihood expression holds. Which $Q_{i}(z^{(j)})$ shall we choose? It turns out that in order to guarantee convergence of the EM algorithm, we must choose $Q_{i}(z^{(j)})$ such that the equality portion of the inequality in the log-likelihood expression must be invoked. In Jensen's inequality, equality is invoked when $X$ is a constant (easily shown since $E[X] = X$). Similarly, invoking equality in our log-likelihood expression means:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{p(z^{(j)}, x^{(i)};\\theta)}{Q_{i}(z^{(j)})} = c$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $c$ is a constant. To accomplish this, $Q_{i}(z^{(j)}) \\propto p(z^{(j)}, x^{(i)};\\theta)$ must be true. In order for this proportionality to be true while having $Q_{i}(z)$ remain as a probability distribution, the following must be true:\n",
    "\n",

    "# 2. Proof of Convergence\n",
    "To show that the EM algorithm convergences upon the optimal $\\theta$ after $n$ iterations, we need to show that $l(\\theta^{(t+1)}) \\ge l(\\theta^{(t)})$, where $t$ represents the $t^{ith}$ iteration. \n",

    "Recall that we have chosen $Q_{i}(z^{(j)}) = p(z^{(j)}|\\:x^{(i)};\\theta)$ because it leads to the equality:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$l(\\theta^{(t)}) = \\sum_{i=1}^{m}\\sum_{j=1}^{u}Q_{i}^{(t)}(z^{(j)})\\:log\\frac{p(z^{(j)}, x^{(i)};\\theta^{(t)})}{Q_{i}^{(t)}(z^{(j)})}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "After finding maximiation step, since we set $\\theta$ to be the parameter that maximizes the log-likelihood, we have the inequality:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$l(\\theta^{(t+1)}) \\ge \\sum_{i=1}^{m}\\sum_{j=1}^{u}Q_{i}^{(t)}(z^{(j)})\\:log\\frac{p(z^{(j)}, x^{(i)};\\theta^{(t+1)})}{Q_{i}^{(t)}(z^{(j)})}$$\n",

    "\n",
    "The inequality involving $l(\\theta^{(t+1)})$ simply comes from Jensen's inequality, using similar logic used before. Hence, we have shown that with each iteration updating $\\theta$, the log-likelihood increases monotonically. \n",
    "\n",
    "There is an alternative perspective viewing the EM algorithm as a method of iteratively increasing the lower-bound on the log-likelihood by maximizing it with respect to $Q$ in the expectation step and then maximizing it with respect to $\\theta$. Let us define lower-bound on the log-likelihood $l(\\theta)$ as $J(Q, \\theta)$:\n",

    "\n",
    "Since $J(Q, \\theta)$ is the lower-bound on $l(\\theta)$, the largest $J(Q, \\theta)$ can be is equal to $l(\\theta)$. Thus, choosing $Q$ such that $J(Q, \\theta) = l(\\theta)$ maximizes $J(Q, \\theta)$ with respect to $Q$.
